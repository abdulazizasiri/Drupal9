Experimenting Drupal 9 


- What is Drupal? 

Drupal is a content mangement system with thousands of add-ons enabling us to build any kind of website. 

- What is a content mangement system? 

in drupal it boils down to the code which is:

1- PHP

2- HTML

3- CSS

4- Ajax

5- YAML 

6- JavaScript

and many more

All of the above roll down to one which we call <code> core </code>

We also have contributed to that modules and themes. 


All of that interact with a database. 

The content and the configuration are all stored in the database. 

So, When someone lands on our Drupal website, Drupal says oh they want the content out of the database that is related to this URL, then druapl.

- There are no file/folders anymore

- Drupal is open source and Free

### Drupal Made out of

1- Core

2- Modules

3- Themes

4- Disributions

5- Community
